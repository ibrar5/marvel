        <p>MCU stands for Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is currently world's greatest and most successful cinematic universe. It is based on Marvel commics. 25 movies and 4 TV series have been released since 2008. These movies are completely watchable for all age. If your age is more than 10, you can watch these movies. These movies are the best movies for teenagers in the world. Usually, 2 or 3 movies of MCU releases per year. So, we can say this universe is extending day by day. If you are a marvel commics lover, then what are you waiting for. You should watch this movies as soon as you can. There is not a single MCU movie which is not good, some are maybe not as good as expacted but some are mind blowing. So, let's see which movies have won everyone's mind and which have not.</p>
        <br>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Incredible Hulk is completely unrelated and have no link with the other MCU movies. The story of this movie and the story of MCU's Hulk is completely different. In this movie Hulk has a lover. But, Hulk is actually a bachelor who fell in love with Natasha. However, this is an MCU movie without any doubt. Because, we have seen Tony Stark in this movie. Although, only William Hurt has returned as a new General Ross in Captain America: Civil War after this movie. At first, MCU wanted to introduce Hulk in this movie. But, as I said this movie is completely unrelated. The 'Hulk' character in this movie is not even acted by Mark Ruffalo. This movie is mainly an action movie. And I must say that this movie is a very good action movie. But, unlike many other MCU movie I was unable to find any fun in this movie. This movie is skippable. There is no problem if someone ignore this movie. Although, I think this movie is better that Iron man-2 or Thor: The Dark World. But, as we are ranking the MCU movies and this movie is unrelated. So, this must should be at the bottom of the list.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Iron man 2 is a very important movie from phase 1. This movie has introduced War Machine and Black Widow to the fans. Also, in Iron Man-2 Nick Fury exposed his plan to create the Avengers to Tony Stark. However, Jon Faverau have made some mistakes. First of all, this movie was like a goalless movie. Because, Jon Faverau's movie contained the stories of many characters including War Machine, Black Widow, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, Pepper Potts and Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. It was like Jon Faverau was in a hurry. As a result, nobody but only iron man got highlighted properly in this movie. And secondly, Natasha Rommannof was introduced as an ordinary S.H.E.I.L.D. agent. But, she is actually an avenger. However, don't think that this movie is skippable just because this is not nice. One must watch this movie to understand phase 1, properly. After all, this is the movie in which War Machine and Black widow introduced and Tony Stark have joined the Avengers.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Thor: The Dark World is an important movie from phase 2. It is a stone related movie. This movie's real problem is that it is a boring movie and many things in the movie were not explained properly including the power of reality stone. I have realized the power of reality stone in this movie and it's power in Avengers: Infinity War was not the same. In this movie there was everything including action and emotion. But, it's problem is there is no fun. As a result, anyone would get bored while watching this movie. And some character were abandoned and some character was completely changed including Korg. Alan Taylor proved that he is not worthy for a superhero movie. However, this movie is an important movie and not skippable. In this movie, MCU have introduced the reality stone or Ethar, and Thor Lost his beloved mother in this movie. So, this movie should be watched even if it is a boring movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Black Widow is a movie that have made us nothing but sad. Black Widow is the first MCU movie after Spider-Man: Far From Home and it is phase 4's first movie. This movie have released after 14 months of it's original release date due to the pandemic situation. And after many years we have watched an MCU movie which is literally boring. It is the first borig MCU movie after Thor: The Dark World. No Character but Natasha Rommannof and Yelena Belova was focused properly. Even character like Red Guardian who was known as the Russian Captain America was not focused properly. The main stry of this movie is about the past story of Natasha Rommannof and also the story of many widow's like Natasha. Although, this movie is a boring movie. But, fights of this movie are not boring at all. Only because of fights, we can say this movie is a way more better than movies like Iron man-2 or Thor: The Dark World. The past story of Natasha Rommannof was very emotional, too. So, an emoyional would must like it. So, we can say that this movie would have fullfilled our hope if the story of this movie were a little more better. This movie is like a filler episode between some very important episodes. I don't think this movie have really done anything important except introducing Yelena Belova.</p>

This movie which have released between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. This is the first movie of any women hero. and there was a rumor that, Captain Marvel will be MCU's strongest hero before this movie was released. So, we expected something very special from this movie. But, this movie have not fullfilled our expactation at all. This movie is not only a movie in which Captain Marvel was introduced to the fans. It is also a movie of Nick Fury's past. In this movie Nick Fury thought about the Avengers for the first time. Some mystery like how Nick Fury lost his eye and from where the name 'Avengers' came from were discovered in this movie. This movie have also introduced Monica Rambeau, who have gained a special power in Wandavision, as the daughter of Maria Rambeau. After reading the first part of this article no one will ever understand why I am saying this movie an imperfect one. But, something was missing in this movie. By the way, this movie must should be watched to enjoy Endgame and phase 4 properly.</p>

This movie was a balanced movie. This movie is a forgotten MCU hit. Almost every MCU fans have forgotten about this movie. Thor is not a boring movie like the Alan Taylor's Thor: The Dark World and also it's not a legendary movie like Thor: Ragnarok. Honestly, when I first watched this movie I thought that, this movie can't be better than this one. But, when I watched Thor's third sequel and some other good MCU movie, I felt that Thor was not perfect. This movie was nether funless like Thor: The Dark World nor actionless. But, everything was like less than enough. I can't say that, this movie is a boring movie or this movie was an imperfect movie. This movie was a perfect one but it was not a legendary. By the way, this is one of the most important of phase 1. This movie should must be watched to enjoy 'The Avengers' movie, properly.</p>

This movie is a perfect sequel of the first Ant-Man. However, in this movie many things have changed. The first Ant-Man was the adventure of how Scott Lang have become Ant-Man. But in this movie it was not just about him. Hope Van Dyne have became the the Wasp in this movie. Not only that, they have gained a vast amount of knowledge about Quantum Tunnel. Which is very important for Endgame. This movie is almost like the previous Ant-Man. But, this movie have not focused in only one plot. Ant Man & The Wasp has made the same mistake as Iron Man 2 did and the ending of this movi was not so good, at least not as good as other MCU movies. But, this movie's fun and adventure have covered it. By the way, if you do not watch this movie before Endgame, you might face some problem while watching Endgame.</p>

This movie is about Scott Lang's earlier life and how he have became the ant-man. This movie is a different movie. Because, this is the first movie in which the character have become a superhero in a world where the Avengers already exist. In this movie Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym were introduced. The story of this movie is based on the character 'Scott Lang', who have become a superhero from a theif. This movie is a very interesting, twisted and funny movie and because of that I think this movie is a perfect movie. This movie has everything but almost no emotional scene. But, I don't think that really matters. But there is one thing that really is a matter, and that is while watching this movie we felt like Scott Lang is not so much important superhero. I mean we felt like he will just be a sidekick of the Avngers and will never play a very important role. By the way, you should watch this movie to enjoy Ant-man's part properly in each and every movie.</p>

This movie is just about Tony Stark's past mistake, which have no relation with any other MCU movie. You just have to watch the previous Iron Man movie to know the character, except this Iron-Man 3 is like a solo movie. This movie was the final sequel of Iron Man. So, we expected something special from this movie. At least, better than the previous Iron man directed by Jon Faverau. And Shane Black was ale to fullfill our hope. This movie is not only a simple superhero movie. Shane Black have made Iron Man 3 a movie with variation. This movie is also a lessonable movie. Iron Man 3 was the perfect ending for MCU's legend Iron Man. Emotion, action, lesson, adventure all of this things were present and balanced. However, this movie does not have any relation with other MCU movies. So, it is most probably the one and only skippable moie of the whole MCU.</p>

This series is also like a 'Captain America-4', because Falcon and Bucky Burnes were Captain America's two nearest person. And secondly, Sam Wills have become Captain America in this series. In this series, we have seen some old faces who were unseen since Captain America: Civil War, like Sharon Carter and Zemo. Don't skip this series just because it is not a movie. This series is like an important MCU movie of five hours. This series contains MCU's most twisted story. It is also a very important series. Kari Skogland have introduced the Flag Smashers in this movie. We have also seen many super soldiers in this. This series is important for phase 4 and it is really a very good one.</p>

This movie introduced Steve Rogers as the Captain America, his best friend Bucky Burnes, his girlfriend Peggy Carter, Hydra and Red Skull to us. In this movie the super soldier serum was introduced clearly for the first time. I used 'clearly' because it was already mentioned in The Incredible Hulk. But, The Incredible Hulk is not a proper MCU movie and it was not mentioned properly. Whatever, Captain America: The First Avenger is a completely balanced movie. We can see everything including fun, adventure, fighting and emotional scene in this movie. This movie's last word "I had a date" is one of the most emotional scene in MCU. The fighting among Steve Rogers and Red Skull was pretty good, too. This movie is MCU's first stone related movie. The Space Stone or Teserract was introduced to the fans in this movie. This movie is a very important movie. You must have to watch this movie. Because without watching this you will understand almost nothing of The Avengers movie.</p>

But, Wandavision have failed to fullfill the expactation. Anybody would doubt, it is an MCU series or not after watching the first three episodes of this series. 'First impression is the best impression', but Wandavision's first impression was too bad. But, I must have to say this, Wandavision's later episodes were pretty amazing. Also, these episodes are very important. In these episodes, Wanda's power have explained, Vision has revived as the White Vision and Monica Rambeau have gained some special power which is pretty much alike with Silver Surfer's power. Wandavision would have listed much higher in this list, even in the top 10 if earlier episodes of this series were a little better.</p>

We had a high expactation for this movie, as it was released after Endgame, more importantly it is the second sequel of MCU's great film, Spider-Man: Homecoming. This movie have fullfilled our expactation. This movie contains one of MCU's most twisted plot. At the first part of the movie, it feels like Misterio is going to be a new Avenger. By the way, this movie is the previous sequel of phase 4's unreleased movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, which might be a very special movie for MCU fans.

This movie was a perfect movie for a teenager and neighbourhood hero, which makes this movie a different one from the previous Spider-Mans. The villain in this movie was also not like someone who is going to destroy whole nation, city or humanity unline the previous spider-man movies. This movie definitely feels more realistic then it's previous versions. This movie was thrilling, funny, full of adventure and have a very twisted plot. This movie pulls a very perfect villain twist. It was really a shocking scene when Vulture was discovered as Liz's father. This movie was more than expected and too perfect. By the way, Spider-Man: Homecoming is not directly related to Avengers: Infinity War. But to enjoy Spider-Man: No Way Home you must have to watch this movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Guardians of the Galaxy-2 is a movie from phase 3 and it is the 2nd sequel of fan favorite Guardians of The Galaxy. This movie is a very good movie like it's previous sequel. Infact, Guardians of the Galaxy 2's plot is more twisted than it's previous sequel. This movie is a distinct movie which have no relation with any movie which have released before this, except it's previous sequel. This movie is full of rom-com, thriller, adventure and some emotional scene. Honestly, I think Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 are almost same. Both of them are really legendary film. But, I ranked Guardians 0f the Galaxy higher because Guardians of The Galaxy was too much twisted. I mean from the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy, we expected that Star Lord's father might be a hero. But, in the end he was a villain. But, this is also a reason why this movie is this much good. In this movie, one of the member of Guardians, Mentis have introduced and in this movie Yondu Udonta died to protect Star Lord, which is unarguably one of the most sorrowful death in MCU. By the way, this movie has a direct relation with Avengers: Infinity War. So, you should watch this movie.</p>

But, in MCU's 10th movie Gardians of The Galaxy we have seen only a few known face . This movie was a very distinct movie because it has no relation with the movies which have released before it. This movie was a perfect movie of rom-com, thriller, adventure, fighting and emotion. This movie have introduced Star Lord, Gamorra, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Racoon, Groot, Yondu and Nebulla to the MCU fans. It have also introduced some very important villain including Ronan and Thanos(Thanos was already introduced in The Avengers. But, in this movie he was mentioned properly and perfectly.). This movie have a few legendary scene including "We are Groot". Whatever, don't skip a legenday movie like Guardians of The Galaxy. This movie is quiet important, too. Because this movie is mainly based on Power Stone. And this movie is the first film about the Guardians of The Galaxy. So, if you skip it, there's a chance that you will not understand the part of Guardians of The Galaxy in the later movies.</p>

This movie is one of the biggest disappoinment in MCU. This movie have really failed to fullfill the expactation. It is the worst and most unpopular Avengers movie untill now. We expected that Avengers: Age of Ultron will surpass it's previous sequel. But this movie is not even close to it's previous sequel. However, Age of Ultron is still a legendary film. This movie has a very wierd plot. After all, this movie's main villain is just a computer programme which is created by one of the Avengers. This movie's main villain Ultron was the toughest opponent for the Avengers after Thanos. Age of Ultron is one of the 5 most important movie of MCU. This movie have introduced Vision, Wanda Maximoff and Pietro Maximoff. You must have to watch this movie. Because I have already said it is one of the 5 most important MCU movie. If you want to skip this movie, there is no need for you to watch MCU movies.</p>

But, Iron Man had no platform when this movie have released. Because MCU was not today's MCU when this movie have released. Before Iron Man have released, Marvel was nothing in front of DC. Like Marvel, Iron Man was also not so famous. Nobody have expected something good from this movie and on the same year DC's legendary movie The Dark Knight have released. But, everything changed after this movie was released. This movie may not be a legendary movie compairing with some latest MCU movie. But, this movie was really a legendary one when it was released.

Doctor Stefen Strange was aproudy doctor who had a vast amount of knowledge. But, his life suddenly changed because of an accident. Because of that, a very skilled doctor suddenly lost his usefullness. His hand became useless. And to fix his hand he went to Karma Taj, a completely different world. He learned about many unknown things and discovered he knew nothing. This movie is very important for both phase 3 and phase 4.

The first movie of Captain America was how Hydra harmed the world at the time of 2nd World War. And this is the movie where Hydra was harming the world in the modern era. Steve Rogers' best pal Bucky Burnes was introduced as the Winter Soldier, which was one of the most shocking moment in all MCU movie. This is the first movie where the main villain (Alexandar Pierce) is powerless. The battle between Captain America and Bucky Burnes was really a legendary battle. Don't even think to skip this movie.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. MCU usually never focused in the story of an anti-hero or villain too much. Before Loki, 23 movies and 2 series have released in MCU. From them, the main character was always a hero (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor etc.) or a team of heroes (The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy). But, Loki is different. Beacuse, Loki has always been the best anti-hero in MCU. Although, in this series none of the characters were very good or very bad. It was like one of Loki's quote <b>"No one bad is ever truly bad or no one good is ever truly good."</b>After escaping with Teserract from New York in 2012 at a different timeline and reality. Loki found himself in a desert. But, then someone came and said to him that, he will be arrested because of the violation againts the "Sacred Timeline". Then, he discovered a new world and heard words like TVA, Variant, Timekeeper, Sacred Timeline for the very first time. At first, even Loki thought it's all an illusion. But, when he saw infinity stones are like showcase here. Then, he believed the reality. A normal person may have lost every hope after this. But, he was Loki after all. Loki went more deeper and deeper. He was discovering more and more unknown, surprising and shocking things. These surprising and shocking things are what which have made Loki a great series. I think, Loki is the funniest movie or series in MCU after Thor: Ragnarok. It is also the most misterious series in MCU. I mean you will not even know what will happen in the next minute. I don't know why but Loki was two step ahead from previous 2 MCU series Wandavision and Falcon and The Winter Soldier. I am saying it because Loki's first episode's veiwer was more than the previous series. I have already said, Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. It's not that MCU never focused on the story of time. But, I have to say this none of those were focused like Loki's. Another important thing about this series is variant. This is the first time we heard a word like this in MCU. But, this word has a great importance this series. I can't say you must have have to watch this series, yet. But, I can say you should watch it.</p>

Because, just before The Avengers DC's legendary film and the final sequel of Christofer Nolan's Badman, 'The Dark Knight Rises' have released. But, The Avengers was much more better than the expactation. This movie is so good because each and every character was focused properly in this movie, even the number of important character was 8 (with Loki and Nick Fury). In this movie a very talented, rich and intelligent mechanics, a scientist who became hulky after the failure of his experiment, a powerful and good soldier from the 2nd World War, The God of Thunder and two special agents of S.H.I.E.L.D formed a team named The Avengers.

Fan-favorite teenager hero Spider-Man and T'challa, the king of Wakanda was introduced in this movie. Like Captain America's previous sequel, Civil War's main villain was also powerless. But, Zemo is really a super intelligent and unarguably the most clever character in MCU. Avengers have divided into two because of Zemo and some misunderstanding between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. This movie is much higher in this list because of the fights in this movie. The final battle between Captain America and Iron Man was legendary and the Airport battle between among Iron-Man, War-Machine, Black Widow, Vision, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Captain America, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, Wanda, Ant-Man is one of the best battle between superheroes. This movie is really an epic movie. But, just like The Avengers this movie have directly competed DC. In fact, here the competition was much more than before. Because Captain America: Civil War and Badman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice are really similar movie. But, Captain America: Civil War is far more better than Badman vs Superman. By the way, this movie is not only a good movie, it is also an important one. As, Avengers have divided into two in this movie. This movie has a great impact on Avengers: Infinity War.

This movie is exceptional and special because of african culture. This is the first MCU movie in which the main hero is black-skinned. Black Panther has a very twisted plot. There were two very important villain in this movie. On the first half, the main villain was Eulisis Claw who was harming Wakanda by taking their vibraniums for more than 3 decades. Erik Killmonger was the villain on the second half because he was T'challa's cousin and prince N'jobu's son, who is right but way of doing things were wrong. Black Panther movie is full of adventure, thriller, fun and specially african culture. While watching this movie, I felt that vibranium and Wakanda is real. Whatever, Black Panther is not so important for Infinity War, but this movie have explained about vibranium which was introduced in MCU in 2011 (Captain America: The First Avenger) seven years before this movie was released.

But, honestly nobody had a high expactation for this movie. Because Kenneth Brannagh's Thor was too ordinary and Alan Taylor's Thor: The Dark World is an example of failure MCU movie and the previous Thors were not too funny. Infact, in Thor's second sequel there was almost no fun. But, Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok is completely opposite of the previous Thors. I think, Thor: Ragnarok is currently MCU's best non-Avengers film. And Thor: Ragnarok is currently MCU's funniest movie. Taika Waititi have not followed the theory of previous Thors. First of all, Taika Waititi have abandoned some very important character. In previous Thors, Jain Foster was the most important character after Thor. But, she was abandoned. However, she will return in Thor: Love and Thunder movie. Asgard's mighty three have played a really important role in the previous Thors. But, in this movie they have killed by Hela just after they were shown. This movie's story was mainly about Thor who left earth and Asgard in search of Infinity Stones and Hulk who have mistakenly lost his way and left the earth in Avengers: Age of Ultron movie. We have seen a changed Thor in this movie. In the beginning of this movie thor was the king of Asgard with long hair, with his main weapon Mjolnir. He was a prince who had everything. But, in the end of this movie Thor was a short-haired orphan who had no land, no friends, no family. Although, Loki was alive. But, later he was killed by Thanos. But, in the end of this movie Thor became a real God of Thunder and he proved that his hammer Mjolnir was not the source of his power. In this movie, we have seen two very important and strong villain (Hela and Surtur) and Thor: Ragnarok is the only MCU movie in which the main villain was not defeated by a hero. In fact, the main villain was defeated by another villain. Thor: Ragnarok is not one of the 5 most important MCU movie. But, it is pretty important. After all, in this movie many important things and people related to Thor was killed or destroyed including: Thor's friends, Thor's father Odin, Thor's weapon Mjolnir and Thor's motherland Asgard.</p>

This is may be the only MCU movie in which importancy of the main villain is more than each and every heroes. Russo brothers have proved that they are very good directors by directing this movie. Because, not 1 or 2 not even 10. There was total 24 heroes in this movie of 150 minutes and each and every one of them had their own interlinked arcs. This movie is one of the best MCU movie because of it's battle. This is currently the most action MCU movie. Because, almost 70% of this movie was battle. Thanos the Mad Titan have attacked the universe including The Avengers and Guardians of The Galaxy, to gain the six infinity stones and destroy half of all living beings in the universe. We have seen many awful deaths in this movie including Loki's death, Heimdall's death, Gamorra's death, Vision's death and the death of 50% of the universe after the snap of Thanos. This is the only MCU movie whose ending is not a happy ending. In some cases, Avengers: Infinity War is even better than Avengers: Endgame. But, after all Endgame is the last sequel of The Avengers and end of a phase. Although for the welfare of MCU it was impossible to make Avengers: Infinity War better than Avengers: Endgame. Because, Infinity War and Endgame are like 2 parts of the same movie. So, if the first part is better than the second, MCU itself would be harmed. However, Avengers: Endgame's viewers is still more than the viewers of Avengers: Infinity War. But, you must have to watch Infinity War before Endgame.

Avengers: Endgame is the second part of Avngers: Infinity War and it is the last sequel of Avengers, released untill now. This movie's concept was changed and this movie is not like a general MCU movie. Because, there was a timeskip of 5 years after the snap of Thanos. This movie is full of unexpected and surprising scene including the Time Heist, Captain America fighting with Mjolnir. We have seen many scenes from the past movies while The Avengers was travelling time. The Time Travel was very adventurous, funny, thrilling and emotional. Each and every hero who was introduced untill then and alive were present in this movie. But, unlike Avengers: Infinity War every one of them did not have their own interlinked arcs. This movie is mainly the story about 11 Avengers (Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Natasha Romannof, Rhoodey, Scott Lang, Nebulla, Rocket and Carrol Danver) who have struggled to save their friends and 50% of all living beings in the universe. Also unlike Avengers: Infinity War this movie has a happy ending. Infact, Avengers have beaten and killed Thanos twice. But, even after that tony Stark and Natasha Romannof have died and Steve Rogers have left the Avengers in this movie. I have already said, 70% of Avengers: Infinity War is battle. But, Endgame is not like that. Infact, in this movie of 180 minutes there was only one important fight of 40 minutes in this movie. But, the fight of full Avengers with Thanos and his army is unarguably one of the best fight in MCU. I think I don't have to say you can skip this movie or not because most of the people who still have not watched the movies of MCU wants to watch these movies only to enjoy and understant Avengers: Endgame properly.</p>
